# SQL Database Project  
## Structured Data Management & Troubleshooting with AI Assistance  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on creating a structured SQL database, defining tables, implementing relationships, and performing data analysis. While AI was not integrated into the system itself, it provided valuable guidance in resolving challenges—particularly during the dataset import process.  

## Key Features  
- Database Creation & Table Design – Structured schema with defined relationships.  
- Dataset Import & Troubleshooting – AI-assisted problem-solving during data import.  
- View Segmentation – Pre-created views for better data structuring and reporting.  

## How AI Assisted  
AI played a supportive role, helping to identify and resolve issues encountered during the dataset import into the created tables. This assistance helped streamline the setup process and ensured proper data integration.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SQL_Project.git  
   ```  
2. Open Superstore_DB.sql in SQL Server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.  
3. Execute table creation scripts to build the database structure.  
4. Import the dataset following resolved troubleshooting steps.  
5. Explore pre-created views for structured data segmentation.  

## Credits  
Project developed with SQL techniques, with AI guidance used specifically for troubleshooting dataset import issues.  
Developed as part of the May 2025 Knowledge Showcase.
